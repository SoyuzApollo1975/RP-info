Backstory:
  Irene was born in the Byzantine Empire during the late Komnenian Byzantine period during the 12th century. She lived with a single father and her mother the goddess Venus. 
She grew up not knowing anything outside her local village. When the Crusade sacked Constantinople in the year 1204, she fled with her father out of the city but 
was captured by some rogue Crusaders. Her father decides to abadon her on the side of the road and she was captured and they sold her into slavery for money. During transport,
 she found out that she would be sold to the Ottoman sultan. Being the naive girl she is she thought they would get a lavish life and all she have to do is be a cup bearer. 
Upon learning the real thing that would be subjected to her through overhearing some guards, she jumped off the caravan and ran off into the forest at night to avoid detection.

  Staying close to an often-traveled road between traders and merchants she was able to pick up a bow that was dropped from the passing merchants and she built her  
arrows from rocks and sticks. Armed with a weapon, she was able to at least hunt small game and forage for food. Determined to somehow head home, she traveled the land west mainly. 
Irene found the abandoned temple of Artemis at Ephesus. At that point, she didn't know what it was so she took refuge in the ruins. She eventually decides to make it her home 
for she doesn't have any idea as to where she is and she risks encountering bandits that might kidnap a random lone girl.

  One day she was out picking berries from some random forest when she spotted a horde of girls all wearing silver, she was paranoid and scared so she retreated into her hiding 
place at the abandoned temple. Unfortunately or fortunately as she would later recall, the horde of the girl's destination was the abandoned temple of Artemis. She was scared
for her life and didn't know if that was some bandit gang or something that could threaten her life. Artemis sensed that there was an extra person near her temple, so Irene 
was then discovered. Irene surrendered to the hunters and realized that they were not a hostile army or bandits. Artemis told Irene about the Greek gods being 
alive and offered her to join the hunt. Irene swore the oath and was accepted into the hunt, she's stayed in the hunt since then.
