"No Gods have friends only self interests." - Irene C.


Backstory:
  Irene was born in the Byzantine empire during the late Komnenian Byzantine period during the 12th century. She lived with a single father and her mother being the goddess venus. 
She grew up not really knowing anyhting outside her local village. When the Crusade that sacked Constanipole in the year 1204, she fleed with her father out of the city but 
was captured by some rogue crusaders. Her father was killed defending her and she was captured and they sold her into slavery for money. During transport she found 
out that she would be sold to the ottoman sultan. Being the naive girl she is she thought they would get a lavish life and all she have to do is be a cup bearer. Upon learning the 
real thing that would be subjected to her thru overhearing some guards, she jumped off the caravan and ran off into the forest at night to avoid detection.

  Staying close to a often travled road between traders and merchants she was able to pick up a bow that was dropped from the passing mechants and she build her own 
arrows from rocks and sticks. Armed with a weapon, she was able to at least hunt small game and forage for food. Determined to somehow head home, she traveled the land west mainly. 
Irene found the abaoned temple of artemis at ephesus. At the point she didnt know what it was so she took refuge in the ruins. She eventually decide to make it her home 
for she dont really have any idea as to where she is and she risk encountering bandits that might kidnap a random lone girl.

  One day she was out picking berries from some random forest she spotted a horde of girls all wearing silver, she being paranoid and scared so she reteated into her hiding 
place at the abadoned temple. Unfortunally or forunally as she would later reacall, the horde of girl's destination was the abadoned temple of Artemis apeprently. She being scared
for her life didnt know if that is some bandit gang or something that could threaten her life. Artemis sensing that there is an extra person near her temple, so Irene was then 
busted out of her hiding. Irene surrendered to the hunters and realize that they are not a hostile army or bandits. Artemis told Irene about greek gods being alive and offered her
to join the hunt. Irene swore the oath and was accepted into the hunt, shes stayed in the hunt since then.
