Personality/Flaws: 
Irene's personality is a blend of the carefree maiden of greek mythology and the modern day portrayal huntresses. Her flaw is that she sometimes takes things too careful and miss chances. (look up britomartis pjo for an idea)
She also is cautious around divine thing in general. (Zeus turns into 9999 different animals in the mythos to do you know what.)

Backstory:
Irene grewup in the 1400s near thrace in modern day Greece. She live on a farm for most of her life as with most people back then. She was related to the emperor Constantine's lineage.
During the seige of constanipole she saw the ottoman army seige the city and successfully storm it.
After constanipole fell the ottoman army conducted raids in nearby villages and it happend to be her village that got raided. 
She along with many was captured as slaves. 

The ottomans liked to send european slaves back tot he heart of the empire and become part of the ottoman sultans haram. 
After Irene learned of her fate, she was loaded onto wagons and send to the Turkish heartland. 
During the slow transit she passed by many  ottoman janissary camps where shoot their muskets and drill, she watched and learned their weapons and how they operate in hopes of one day escaping. 

At this point the ottoman army is streched so there was  manpower shotrage plus she is in their rear and every solider got sent to the frontlines ready to invade the Balkans.
The day came she was able to steal the lone guards weapons and equipement and escape into the wildreness. 
She realized that it is impossible to steal food from the heavely guarded grain storage of the ottomans, so she resort to hiding in the forest and tried to hunt small game to survive.
Irene found the abaoned temple of artemis at ephesus. At the point she didnt know what it was so she took refuge in the ruins. 

One night a horde of girls in silver appeared and being scared Irene croched and stayed low and her musket loaded. 
Unforunantlly since matchlock muskets at the time is unreliable and Irene wasent paying attention it fired randomly after the fuse got lit. 
The hunt obviously noticed a loud band and Irene just stood up and surrendered. 
Irene surrendered to the hunters and realize that they are not the sultans army or bandits. Artemis told Irene about greek gods being alive and the hunt. Irene swore the oath and was accepted into the hunt.
